This estimate will assign probability $0$ to any state transition not seen in the training data. To avoid this problem, we use the simple `add-1 smoothing`.<br>\n",

    "In our project, there will be $N$ states (including the special states). We use the following rules:<br>\n",

    "- For the `BEGIN` state, there is no transition to it, i.e., the probability is indeed $0.0$.\n",

Therefore, the state transition probabilities from the `BEGIN` state and those to the `END` state need to be considered. For example, the generation probability of an observation sequence $o_1$ with state sequence $[BEGIN, 1, END]$ is $A[BEGIN, 1] · B[1, o_1] · A[1, END]$. The transition probabilities from the `BEGIN` state can be deemed as equivalent to the initial probability distribution $\\pi$ in the standard HMM literature.\n",
